# Terms of service

## By using Biscotte, you agree that you'll follow this code of conduct.

Spaming includes requesting off-topic music to disrupt discussions, promote a product, solicit donations, advertise a job / internship / gig, or flooding discussions with files or text.

If you see someone harass, troll, or spam anywhere using the Biscotte bot, notify me through the [Discord Privates Messages] to `@Turlututur#8694`. The moderator team will take any action we deem appropriate, up to and including banning the offender from the use of Biscotte.
